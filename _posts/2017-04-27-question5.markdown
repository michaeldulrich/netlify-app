If I could change one thing about the challenge, I think I'd add some more of the "figure it out" type stuff, like the bonus challenge at the end. The questions are great and are really making me think, but I like the tinkering around aspect a lot too. If I were looking to hire the position, I think I'd want to hire someone who would like to dive in and figure out something they don't know, and more bonus challenges like that would be a good way to pick them out from the crowd.

The only thing that catches my eye to change on the job posting is this sentence: "This is not to say that there isn’t mobility to other roles within the company, but instead that right now, and for the next while, providing technical support is what you want to do." The phrasing, particularly in the "but instead" section feels off to me. "Instead of" might make it more clear, but I might just rewrite the whole sentence to "For right now you should be enthusiastic about providing technical support, but there are mobility options to other roles within the company down the road” or something similar.
