The first question is to rank the top 5 and bottom from this [list][list].

Fav 5:
Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case.
Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter.
Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers.
Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day

Least Fav 5:
Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup.
Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model.
Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers.
Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product.
Help manage communications during a service outage.

Now, it's worth noting that picking a "least favorite 5" for this list was a nearly impossible task. None of these responsibilities are bad. But if I have to pick, those seem like the ones that might stress me out the most.
