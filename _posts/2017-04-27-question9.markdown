*After reading this question, I wasn't sure if I should form my answer as a reply email or a support article. I thought it'd be fun to do both*

[Customer Name],

I'm so sorry to hear that you're having trouble getting your site to build. I've worked on my own sites and know how frustrating it can be when it doesn't work. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you to help get it fixed. What I'd like to do is gather some more information that will be helpful to getting to the solution, if that's okay.

The first place I would look is your most recent deployment. A site generation tool can fail to build when information is changed that it doesn't understand. If you send me your site URL along with the console output on the latest deploy (which you can find in your computer's console if you're using the command line or by clicking on a specific deploy on your site's Deploys page), I'd be more than happy to work with you to get this figured out.
