I may be biased since I used to work for them, but I think Apple's guide for [Swift][swift] is absolutely excellent. Before I started learning Ruby/Rails I dedicated some time to learning iOS development and Apple's guides are easy to read and understand, include examples (that for a while, at least, included direct references to Firefly, one of the world's greatest TV shows), and they even have an iOS app to help ground you in the fundamentals through a game of sorts.

To use a specific example, I may not know anything about Properties in object-oriented programming, so there's a whole [page][properties] that explains to me not only how to use them in Swift, but what they are.

Though it isn't a developer tool, I think Apple's customer-facing support pages are also in a league nearly of their own. When I try to solve an issue with an Apple product and I turn to Google, I almost always find an article from Apple's knowledgebase that solves the problem. I would even use these articles when I worked technical support for Apple because they were so easy to find and understand.
