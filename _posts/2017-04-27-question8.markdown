I think the first major challenge a less-technical internet user would face is wondering what type of record is appropriate. To tell an end-user that a CNAME record is the correct one without explaining what a CNAME record really is would be a mistake. The saying is overused, but it's better to teach a user to fish than it is to just hand them the fish without explaining what a fish really is or what it's for.

Taking a step even further back, I think it's fully possible that you'd need to anticipate that a user might not know what DNS is. A user could conceivably go their entire life using the internet without understanding how DNS functions or why they need it. This is likely the biggest challenge that a less-technical user would face. For everything they visit on the internet, the DNS is just there and it happens without them knowing it. Analogies about street addresses and nicknames for physical places would work well here. You could explain that if you want to get to Walmart, you can type that name into the search box and the GPS will translate that to the street address and help you navigate there.
